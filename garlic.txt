Day old French sticks, which are usually reduced in price in
supermarkets, can be used to make garlic bread. These could be
frozen for future use.

Always keep butter and margarine in the fridge.

HOME MADE GARLIC BREAD
INGREDIENTS


550 g cake flour
1 packet or 10 grams instant yeast
40 grams sugar
40 grams soft  butter
10 grams salt
1 cup luke warm water
½ cup crushed garlic
Pinch crushed black pepper
4 teaspoons chopped parsley
50ml olive oil
2 teaspoons rock salt
250g/half block butter softened

METHOD
•	 Pre heat your oven to 175 degrees Celsius as well as greasing a large baking tray with spray & cook or butter.
•	 In a large clean mixing bowl place all the dry ingredients & the soft butter.  Gently mix together by hand until the
	 butter is well incorporated with the dry ingredients.
•	 Make a well in the centre of the mixing bowl & pour in the water.
•	 Only use one hand to mix the ingredients together at this stage.
•	 Once it has started combining together place your dough onto a clean work surface that has been lightly floured.
•	 Mix the dough together using both hands, what you will be doing is pulling the dough towards you with one
	 hand & folding it into itself with the other.
•	 Continue doing this until a smooth ball is formed.
•	 If the dough is too wet add more flour, if it is too dry add more water. Just keep in mind to add a little bit at a time
	 or else you could end up making it too dry or too wet.
•	 The dough should feel soft & smooth once completed.
•	 This would take anywhere from 5-10 minutes, all depending how experienced you are when it comes to making
	 bread dough by hand.
•	 Once the dough is ready to be used halve the mixture.
•	 Flour a work surface & lay out your dough, keep the other half of the dough mixture covered to prevent it from
	 drying out.
•	 You are now going to shape your dough by hand in order to make a ‘loaf ’.
•	 Do so by rolling it out by hand on a surface  & making a cylinder like shape
•	 Place the loaves onto your greased baking tray.
•	 Your next step is to cover the baking tray with cling wrap-or foil if you don’t have any cling wrap.

HOME MADE GARLIC BREAD
•	 You are going to allow the bread dough to proof-letting it double in size, allowing it to be light & fluffy.  It is best
	 to try proof it in a warm area of the kitchen.
•	 Let it proof for 15-20 minutes or until the loaves have doubled in size.
•	 You will notice the dough is a lot softer as well after proofing.
•	 Remove the plastic wrap or foil once the dough has proofed enough.
•	 Place in the preheated oven & bake for 10 minutes, the bread should be golden brown on the outside & when you
	 stick a toothpick or knife into it in order to check the bread it should come out clean-no raw dough sticking to it.
•	 Once the breads are cooked remove from the oven & leave to cool.
•	 Once cooled down you can start slicing into them, making sure to not cut all the way through. Just enough so you
	 can put enough filling in each compartment.
•	 Mix your butter, parsley, black pepper & pinch of rock salt together to make a paste.
•	 In each compartment place a little bit of your butter mix, using a knife to spread it evenly in on all sides. Try to
	 put as much filling in each slit as possible.
•	 Once you have filled both of the loaves try & rub the outside of each loaf with any of the remaining butter mix.
•	 Take a large amount of foil & tear off a rectangular shaped piece -the foil should be much wider & longer in
	 diameter than your breads. You will also need to tear two pieces as you have two loaves of garlic bread.
•	 Rub it with your olive oil & sprinkle some rock salt along the surface
•	 Place one loaf on one rectangle of foil; rub the top of the bread with some more olive oil & a sprinkle of rock salt.
•	 Fold the foil over the loaf in order to completely cover it. & make sure to seal any open areas.
•	 Your garlic bread is now ready to bake.
•	 Just keep it in the fridge till ready for use & then bake in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 5-10 mi
nutes.
